"""Find the Longest Increasing Subsequence in Circular manner


Given an array, the task is to find to LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) in a circular way.


Examples : 
    Input : arr[] = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
    Output : 2
    Although there is no LIS in a given array 
    but in a circular form there can be
    {1, 5}, {2, 5}, ...... 

    Input : arr[]= {5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3}
    Output : 6
    {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} will be the LIS in the
    circular manner.
    

Append the same elements(i.e. whole array) with the given array.
For every window of size n(no. of elements in the given array), perform LIS.
Return maximum length.    



For example : Given array is {1, 4, 6, 2, 3}

After appending elements resultant array
will be {1, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 2, 3}.

Now for every consecutive n elements perform LIS.
1- {1, 4, 6, 2, 3} --3 is length of LIS.
2- {4, 6, 2, 3, 1} --2 is length of LIS.
3- {6, 2, 3, 1, 4} --3
4- {2, 3, 1, 4, 6}-- 4 {2, 3, 4, 6}
5- {3, 1, 4, 6, 2} --3.
6- {1, 4, 6, 2, 3} Original list.

So, maximum length of LIS in circular manner is 4. 
As in the last window we will have the same elements as in the given array which we donâ€™t need to compute again, 
so we can append only n-1 elements to reduce the number of operations.
