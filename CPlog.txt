Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        len_h = len(haystack)

Approach 1: One Pass + Count
Let's first implement a pretty straightforward one-pass idea: to iterate over the array and count the number of zeros in-between the "neighbor" 1s. Each two neighbor 1s should have at least k zeros in-between. If it's not the case, return false.

Approach 2: Bit Manipulation
This approach would be more suitable for the Facebook variation of this problem, when the input is not a binary array but an integer.

In this situation, the problem could be solved with the bitwise trick to remove trailing zeros in the binary representation:

# remove trailing zeros
while x & 1 == 0:
    x = x >> 1


Algorithm

1. Convert binary array into integer x. Note that this conversion always works fine in Python where there is no limit on the value of integers. In Java, the usage of this approach is limited by the integer capacity.

2. Consider the base cases: return true if x == 0 or k == 0.

3 .Remove trailing zeros in the binary representation of x. That ensures that the last bit of x is 1-bit.

4. While x is greater than 1:

	Remove trailing 1-bit with the right shift: x >>= 1.

	Remove trailing zeros one by one, and count them using counter count. The number of zeros in-between 1-bits should be greater or equal to k. Hence, return false if count < k.

5. We're here because all 1-bits are separated by more than k zeros. Return true.



class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> bool:
        # convert binary array into int
        x = 0
        for num in nums:
            x = (x << 1) | num
        
        # base case
        if x == 0 or k == 0:
            return True
        
        # remove trailing zeros
        while x & 1 == 0:
            x = x >> 1
        
        while x != 1:
            # remove trailing 1-bit
            x = x >> 1
            
            # count trailing zeros
            count = 0
            while x & 1 == 0:
                x = x >> 1
                count += 1
                
            # number of zeros in-between 1-bits

1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.

A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:

The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i < j.
Return the indices of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.

Example 1:
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is:

- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 2 
- Row 4: 5

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

1089. Duplicate Zeros
Given a fixed length array arr of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.

Do the above modifications to the input array in place, do not return anything from your function.

    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: list[int]) -> None:
        """

                arr.insert(i, 0)

Find the number of zeros which would be duplicated. Let's call it possible_dups. We do need to make sure we are not counting the zeros which would be trimmed off. Since, the discarded zeros won't be part of the final array. The count of possible_dups would give us the number of elements to be trimmed off the original array. Hence at any point, length_ - possible_dups is the number of elements which would be included in the final array.

Note: In the diagram above we just show source and destination array for understanding purpose. We will be doing these operations only on one array.
Handle the edge case for a zero present on the boundary of the leftover elements.

Let's talk about the edge case of this problem. We need to be extra careful when we are duplicating the zeros in the leftover array. This care should be taken for the zero which is lying on the boundary. Since, this zero might be counted as with possible duplicates, or may be just got included in the left over when there was no space left to accommodate its duplicate. If it is part of the possible_dups we would want to duplicate it otherwise we don't.

An example of the edge case is - [8,4,5,0,0,0,0,7]. In this array there is space to accommodate the duplicates of first and second occurrences of zero. But we don't have enough space for the duplicate of the third occurrence of zero. Hence when we are copying we need to make sure for the third occurrence we don't copy twice. Result = [8,4,5,0,0,0,0,0]

Iterate the array from the end and copy a non-zero element once and zero element twice. When we say we discard the extraneous elements, it simply means we start from the left of the extraneous elements and start overwriting them with new values, eventually right shifting the left over elements and creating space for all the duplicated elements in the array.

1844. Replace All Digits with Characters
You are given a 0-indexed string s that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices.

For example, shift('a', 5) = 'f' and shift('x', 0) = 'x'.
For every odd index i, you want to replace the digit s[i] with shift(s[i-1], s[i]).

121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
IMPORTant, 5 levels of same question. read the solution

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

169. Majority Element
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

mysol: 97%
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        l = len(nums)//2
        dic = {}
        for n in nums:
            dic[n] = dic.get(n, 0) + 1
        return max(dic, key=dic.get)


Approach 1: Brute Force

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        majority_count = len(nums)//2
        for num in nums:
            count = sum(1 for elem in nums if elem == num)
            if count > majority_count:
                return num

Algorithm
The brute force algorithm iterates over the array, and then iterates again for each number to count its occurrences. As soon as a number is found to have appeared more than any other can possibly have appeared, return it.
O(n^2), O(1) 



Approach 2: HashMap

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        counts = collections.Counter(nums)
        return max(counts.keys(), key=counts.get)

O(n) O(n)



Approach 3: 

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums)//2]

O(nlogn), O(1) or O(n) depending whether we store the array.



Approach 4: Randomization

Because a given index is likely to have the majority element, we can just select a random index, check whether its value is the majority element, return if it is, and repeat if it is not. The algorithm is verifiably correct because we ensure that the randomly chosen value is the majority element before ever returning.

import random

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        majority_count = len(nums)//2
        while True:
            candidate = random.choice(nums)
            if sum(1 for elem in nums if elem == candidate) > majority_count:
                return candidate


worst case is legit O(inf)
avg case or expected case is O(n)
O(1) for space



Approach 5: Divide and Conquer

1. Here, we apply a classical divide & conquer approach 
2. that recurses on the left and right halves of an array until an answer can be trivially achieved for a length-1 array.
3. Note that because actually passing copies of subarrays costs time and space, we instead pass lo and hi indices that describe the relevant slice of the overall array.
4. In this case, the majority element for a length-1 slice is trivially its only element, so the recursion stops there. 
5. If the current slice is longer than length-1, we must combine the answers for the slice's left and right halves. 
6. If they agree on the majority element, then the majority element for the overall slice is obviously the same. 
7. If they disagree, only one of them can be "right", so we need to count the occurrences of the left and right majority elements to determine which subslice's answer is globally correct. 
8. The overall answer for the array is thus the majority element between indices 0 and n.

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums, lo=0, hi=None):
        def majority_element_rec(lo, hi):
            # base case; the only element in an array of size 1 is the majority
            # element.
            if lo == hi:
                return nums[lo]

            # recurse on left and right halves of this slice.
            mid = (hi-lo)//2 + lo
            left = majority_element_rec(lo, mid)
            right = majority_element_rec(mid+1, hi)

            # if the two halves agree on the majority element, return it.
            if left == right:
                return left

            # otherwise, count each element and return the "winner".
            left_count = sum(1 for i in range(lo, hi+1) if nums[i] == left)
            right_count = sum(1 for i in range(lo, hi+1) if nums[i] == right)

            return left if left_count > right_count else right

        return majority_element_rec(0, len(nums)-1)



O(nlogn)
O(lgn)





***
Approach 6: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
Intuition:
If we had some way of counting instances of the majority element as +1 and instances of any other element as -1, summing them would make it obvious that the majority element is indeed the majority element.

algorithm:
1. Essentially, what Boyer-Moore does is look for a suffix sufsuf of nums where suf[0]suf[0] is the majority element in that suffix. To do this, we maintain a count, which is incremented whenever we see an instance of our current candidate for majority element and decremented whenever we see anything else.

2. Whenever count equals 0, we effectively forget about everything in nums up to the current index and consider the current number as the candidate for majority element.

3. It is not immediately obvious why we can get away with forgetting prefixes of nums - consider the following examples (pipes are inserted to separate runs of nonzero count).

[7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7 | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 7, 7]

4. Here, the 7 at index 0 is selected to be the first candidate for majority element. count will eventually reach 0 after index 5 is processed, so the 5 at index 6 will be the next candidate. 

5.  In this case, 7 is the true majority element, so by disregarding this prefix, we are ignoring an equal number of majority and minority elements - therefore, 7 will still be the majority element in the suffix formed by throwing away the first prefix.

[7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7 | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 5, 5, 5, 5]

6. Now, the majority element is 5 (we changed the last run of the array from 7s to 5s), but our first candidate is still 7.

7. In this case, our candidate is not the true majority element, but we still cannot discard more majority elements than minority elements (this would imply that count could reach -1 before we reassign candidate, which is obviously false).

8. Therefore, given that it is impossible (in both cases) to discard more majority elements than minority elements, we are safe in discarding the prefix and attempting to recursively solve the majority element problem for the suffix. 

9. Eventually, a suffix will be found for which count does not hit 0, and the majority element of that suffix will necessarily be the same as the majority element of the overall array.

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        count = 0
        candidate = None

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

        return candidate

its O(n), O(1)




















172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.
Follow up: Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?

class Solution:
    def trailingZeroes(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Trailing 0s in n! = Count of 5s in prime factors of n!
        #                   = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ....
        i=5
        count = 0
        while (n / i>= 1):
            count += n // i
            i *= 5
        return count

    def trailingZeroes(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
 
    # Keep dividing n by
    # 5 & update Count
        while(n >= 5):

            count += n

233. Number of Digit One
Hard
Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

mysol: 
class Solution:
    def countDigitOne(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while(i <= n):
            j = i * 10
            count += ((n // j) * i + min(max(n % j -i + 1, 0), i))
            i *= 10

        return count

Approach #2 Solve it mathematically
Iterate over i from 1 to n incrementing by 10 each time:

Add (n/(i*10))*i to countr representing the repetition of groups of i sizes after each (i*10) interval.

Add min(max((n mod (i*10)) - i + 1 ,0),i) to countr representing the additional digits dependant on the digit in iith place as described in intuition.

C++
int countDigitOne(int n)
{
    int countr = 0;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i *= 10) {
        long long divider = i * 10;
        countr += (n / divider) * i + min(max(n % divider - i + 1, 0LL), i);
    }
    return countr;
}

(Thats what I did.)
O(log10(n)), O(1)

    def countDigitOne(self, n: int) -> int:
