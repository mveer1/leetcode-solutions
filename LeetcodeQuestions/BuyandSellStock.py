"""121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
IMPORTant, 5 levels of same question. read the solution

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

The points of interest are the peaks and valleys in the given graph. We need to find the largest peak following the smallest valley. We can maintain two variables - minprice and maxprofit corresponding to the smallest valley and maximum profit (maximum difference between selling price and minprice) obtained so far respectively.

    public int maxProfit(int prices[]) {
